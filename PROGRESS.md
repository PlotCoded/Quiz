<ul>
<li>When I press the continue function after the first question so question 2 and above in the details page, I get an error. Update, it happens when I remove the number in the marks entry widget, it returns `expected floating-point number but got "" ` because in the entry, there is nothing in it. About 20:00, 23/09/25
</li>
<li>Found the solution, I just changed the data type of the entry from IntVar to StringVar. This allows/prevent the floating error from occurring as obviously, string has no floating problems. 20:38 23/09/25</li>

<li>20:48 Another problem right now is that when I move forward, the time and marks entry values do not change to the saved value inserted before it, it returns the value of the previous widgets instead, backwards works fine, it returns the value of the saved value inserted, but when you go forward, it doesn't work properly
</li>
<li>17:22. Decided to leave it alone for now in the mean time, there are other features to focus on that are more important to complete, those other problems can be fixed later on in the future. 28/09/25</li>

<li>17:39 Moving on Edit widgets section 28/09/25. Right now, I have the problem of argument passage, I can't pass in the topic name as an argument properly. It just passes in the last topic in the menu(list of buttons)</li>
<li>21:20 6/10/25. I have fixed the issue and now I have finished the Edit change details about topic par</li>

<li>21:18 09/10/25. Moving on to "Change a Question" page</li>
<li>22:33 09/10/25. I have made the progress of when you click that button "Change a Question" on its option menu, it shows you the questions in the form of a checkboxes of that topic you choose on the scroll window</li>

<li>11:32 24/10/25. Moving one to the problem of functionality and interface, when I click any of the check boxes in Choose a Question Widget, it doesn't do any backend functionalities and implementing interaction with the user</li>
<li>I had skipped that problem, can't find the solution at this moment</li>

<li>07:59 31/10/25 Moved on to a new problem, updating the question when you click on a change a question checkbox. Done the time and marks widgets, also the question label instruction label</li>
</ul>
